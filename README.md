# ✨ About

> Hi there! 👋
>
> If you’ve made it to my profile, here’s a little about me: I studied web application development because it was close to home, but I’ve always felt the need to express my creativity. That’s why I’ve spent the past few years balancing my experience as a front-end developer with my online degree in Graphic Design. Four years later, I’m looking for an opportunity to combine these two passions professionally, as they’re both equally important to me 💗.
>
> Throughout my journey, I’ve taken courses in areas I’m passionate about: UX and Product Design, Full-Stack Development, 3D Modeling, Video Games, Illustration… I’ve even been learning Japanese for two years! I love discovering new things; learning has become an essential part of my life.
>
> This past year, I also decided to study teaching, as I’d love to share what I’ve learned and create valuable content for others in the future. This has led me to explore research in the social sciences within education area which I’ve recently discovered.
